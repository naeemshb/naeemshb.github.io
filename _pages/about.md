# About Me
I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Oklahoma, focusing on feature engineering and classification through genetic programming. My research explores advanced data-driven methods to optimize and streamline classification tasks, with an emphasis on evolutionary computation techniques. I am passionate about translating theoretical insights into practical solutions that address complex real-world challenges. By bridging academic research with industry applications, I aim to drive innovation in machine learning and contribute to the growing body of knowledge in computational intelligence.
