## Current Research

- **Using Bio inspired algorithms for dimension reduction **  
  

- **Classification in High-Dimensional Spaces**  
  Investigating methods that handle complex data with large numbers of features efficiently.

## Past Projects
- Bio_inspired algorithms for community detection and also in recommender systems in single and multi objective models (I continue some other projects on this field yet).
